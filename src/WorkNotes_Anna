Work notes of Anna 

Currently working on the RelationalModel, and its tests.
Trying to express the properties of the model in the tests, as well as making executable tests for them. 

There are errors in Tree that is due to an interface update where i was uncertain what the intention 
of the original code was.

RelationalModel has a general API, while LanguageModel will build on RelationalModel but have 
additionally language-related API options. 

added graph visualization option:
GraphViewer.view(RelationalModel model);
 -> could have added some interactivity, but won't spend time on it 
	now since graph library isn't particularly pretty and can't be used in browser. 
This viewing option can be used for debugging instead of the sysout-tostring-call on graphs.
